## Token Migration

This is a simple token migration contract that allows users to migrate their tokens from an old token to a new token.

The contract is designed to be used in a two-way migration, but can be configured to be unidirectional by the deployer of the contract.

### Running This Code

You can build the contract suite with the following command:

```bash
forge build
```

You can run the unit tests with the following command:
```bash
forge test
```
